HiDoc is built upon React/ React Bootstrap.


Setup:
---
- In terminal (only if the root is empty):
`npx create-react-app - --use-npm`
- Why?
Creating a new setup upon an existing template or app will make the code hard to maintain and hard to make sense.


Run:
---
- In terminal:
`npm start`
You may need to change the directory
